# COVID-19-Predict

This project aims to model and predict the spread of COVID-19 in several countries using the Johns Hopkins University Dataset. The model predicted the spread with 95% accuracy in the US between March 26 and April 10.
I have used ridge-regression with lambda,threshold and window-size tuning with a leveling off.
